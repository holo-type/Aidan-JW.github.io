          Untitled freewrite (2022)

Gnawing at roots
to deprive the above of what's beneath.
It never stops, the cycles
turning like grindstones
Amidst a vast system
turning and churning
Waves and fire.
But to find a speck 
That shines on a ray of golden nothing
On a backdrop of green
Nothing can be better,
I think 
And not many can find.
Can this special moment
Be stripped, pried from the cold
Rocky hands
Of crumbling statues
Which we appear to be
And fool ourselves
Into being?
Is it so
is it nothing, everything
A blackness eternal
And the lake of fire
in the dandelions that sprout 
On the fresh mornings we delight to rise to
On days which eat us away.
End the cycle
a common theme
But the greatest fear 
Locked away
Forever isolated on an island
Of sculpted iron.


Halls (2022)

Dare to find those signs of life
that lie across these sacred halls
Laid to rest, and kept to waste
Indifferent to your mortal calls

Among them find a cry ring out
Slapping silent cross sanctum walls
I'm here, it shouts, with glassy gaze
Reflecting through immortal thralls.

Interloper!
Your search is over
Come to find
At last forgotten

A cry, a silent cry
Absorbed and swallowed shut
The everlasting voiceless
Unchanging
Untouched


Untitled freewrite (2023)

Simplicity commanded.
Enacted, overshared
still remnants remain
Of something sitting cold
still smoking in the ash

How long will this take?
To be consumed by what was wanted
Is wanted
Shall attain but still
greater things
Wrapped in shiny foil that glistens 
Like rain
Like blood
Like something else entirely.

Matte painted, spread thin
Robustness overlooked 
by many not more
Of these things left suspended
In the bottom of a glass

Where does it all go?
Asks the question that knows not it's a question
Flashing and flashing
But no extravagance or romance
Can penetrate the dull depths
Of what consumes the most precious thing
A thing forever slipping
Through cracks undetected
Running deeper still
Than the hardened creases of the palm.
